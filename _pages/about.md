Hi! I am an undergraduate student at National Taiwan University, majoring in electrical engineering. I have achieved a major GPA of 4.28 out of 4.30 and am honored to be recognized as an honorary member of Phi Tau Phi Scholastic Society (for top 1% of college graduates). I am currently working in the <a href='https://sites.google.com/eecs.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eecslab'>Energy-Efficient Circuits and Systems Lab, NTU</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=943022">Prof. Tsung-Te Liu</a>, and the <a href="https://sites.google.com/keio.jp/keio-csg/home?authuser=0">Computing and Sensing Group, Keio (Japan)</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.st.keio.ac.jp/en/tprofile/elec/yoshioka_kentaro.html">Prof. Kentaro Yoshioka</a>. 

My research interests span <strong>Memory-Centric Computing, Neural Network Processor, and Computer Architecture</strong>. I like to design new and cool stuff. In my free time, I like to travel, do some sports, play puzzle-solving games, and explore new dessert shops.

Currently, I am actively seeking a Ph.D. program for the Fall of 2024.

Here is my <a href="assets/pdf/CHEN_YUNG_CHIN_CV.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a>.
